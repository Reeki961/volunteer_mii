Volunteer Mii - Sign-up Page
A modern, multi-step sign-up form designed for a frictionless user onboarding experience. This single-page application provides a welcoming interface for prospective volunteers in the UK, guiding them through registration with clear, manageable steps.

üìã Project Description
This project is the front-end implementation of "Volunteer Mii," a platform designed to connect volunteers with meaningful opportunities. The core focus of this codebase is to solve the user onboarding problem by creating a quick, intuitive, and non-intimidating sign-up process. It breaks down the registration into smaller, logical sections to reduce user fatigue and increase completion rates.

The application uses a dark, accessible color scheme and leverages vanilla JavaScript for all its logic, demonstrating a lightweight and dependency-free approach to front-end development.
